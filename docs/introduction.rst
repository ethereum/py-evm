Introduction
============


Py-EVM is a new implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) written in Python.

If none of this makes sense to you yet we recommend to checkout the
`Ethereum <https://ethereum.org>`_ website as well as a
`higher level description <http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html>`_
of the Ethereum project.

Goals
-----

The main focus is to enrich the Ethereum ecosystem with a Python implementation that:

* Supports Ethereum 1.0 as well as 2.0 / Serenity
* Is well documented
* Is easy to understand
* Has clear APIs
* Runs fast and resource friendly
* Is highly flexible to support:

  * Public chains
  * Private chains
  * Consortium chains
  * Advanced research
