py-evm 0.5.0-alpha.0 (2021-09-30)
---------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

**London Support**

- Pass all London tests from the ethereum/tests repo (`#2017 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/2017>`__)
- Implement `EIP-1559 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559>`_ for London support. (`#2013 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/2013>`__)
- Implement `EIP-3198 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198>`_ for London support. (`#2015 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/2015>`__)

- Implement `EIP-3529 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3529>`_ for London support. (`#2020 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/2020>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Replace local timestamps with UTC timestamps (`#2013 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/2013>`__)

  - Use UTC timestamp instead of local time zone, when creating a header.
  - Use UTC for clique validation.

- Was overly permissive on the header gas limit by one gas. (`#2021 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/2021>`__)

  - Make header gas limit more restrictive by one, in various places.
  - Validate uncle gas limits are within bounds of parent. This was previously not validated at all.
- Erase return data for exceptions with `erases_return_data` flag set to True and for CREATE / CREATE2 computations with insufficient funds (`#2023 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/2023>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed old options and methods for creating a header, now that headers vary by fork. (`#2013 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/2013>`__)

  - :meth:`eth.rlp.headers.BlockHeader.from_parent()` is gone, because you should
    always use the VM to create a header (to make sure you get the correct type).
  - Can no longer supply some fields to the genesis, like bloom and parent_hash.


Internal Changes - for Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Misc test improvements (`#2013 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/2013>`__)

  - some test_vm fixes:

    - use the correctly paired VMs in PoW test
    - make sure *only* the block number is invalid in block number validity test
  - more robust test fixture name generation
  - run a newer version of the lint test from `make lint`
- Various upgrades and related updates (`#2016 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/2016>`__)

  - Upgrade pytest and pytest-xdist. Caching was causing very slow test runs locally in pytest v5
  - Update ethereum/tests (Updated in various PRs. At release time, checked out at v10.0)
  - Remove json-fixture caching to resolve stale cache issues that caused test
    failures (at some expense to speed)
  - Make xdist failures show up correctly in the transition tests
- During fixture tests, verify that the generated genesis block matches the fixture's RLP-encoding. (`#2022 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/2022>`__)
- Squash sphinx warnings with a small documentation reorg. (`#2021 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/2021>`__)


py-evm 0.4.0-alpha.4 (2021-04-07)
---------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add Python 3.9 support (`#1999 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1999>`__)


Internal Changes - for Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Update ethereum/tests fixture to v8.0.2, mark some new tests as too slow for CI. (`#1998 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1998>`__)


Miscellaneous internal changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Update blake2b-py requirement from >=0.1.2 to >=0.1.4 (`#1999 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1999>`__)


py-evm 0.4.0-alpha.3 (2021-03-24)
---------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Expose a ``type_id`` on all transactions. It is ``None`` for legacy transactions. (`#1996 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1996>`__)
- Add new LegacyTransactionFieldsAPI, with a v field for callers that want to access v directly. (`#1997 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1997>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fix a crash in :meth:`eth.chains.base.Chain.get_transaction_receipt` and
  :meth:`eth.chains.base.Chain.get_transaction_receipt_by_index` that resulted in this exception:
  ``TypeError: get_receipt_by_index() got an unexpected keyword argument 'receipt_builder'`` (`#1994 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1994>`__)


py-evm 0.4.0-alpha.2 (2021-03-22)
---------------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Add Berlin block numbers for Goerli and Ropsten. Correct the type signature for
  TransactionBuilderAPI and ReceiptBuilderAPI, because deserialize() can take a list of bytes for the legacy
  types. (`#1993 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1993>`__)


py-evm 0.4.0-alpha.1 (2021-03-22)
---------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Berlin Support

  - EIP-2718: Typed Transactions -- no new functionality, really. It is mostly
    refactoring in preparation for EIP-2930. (which does churn the code a
    fair bit) (`#1973 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1973>`__)
  - EIP-2930: Optional access lists. Implement the new transaction type 1, which pre-warms account &
    storage caches from EIP-2929, and adds first-class chain_id support. (`#1975 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1975>`__)
  - EIP-2929: Gas cost increases for state access opcodes. Charge more for cold-cache access of account
    and storage. (`#1974 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1974>`__)
  - EIP-2565: Update ModExp precompile gas cost calculation (`#1976 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1976>`__ & `#1989 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1989>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Uncles with the same timestamp as their parents are invalid. Reject them, and add the test from
  ethereum/tests. (`#1979 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1979>`__)


Performance improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Got a >10x speedup of some benchmarks and other tests, by adding a new :meth:`eth.chains.base.MiningChain.mine_all`
  API and using it. This is a public API, and should be used whenever all the transactions are known
  up front, to get a significant speedup. (`#1967 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1967>`__)


Internal Changes - for Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Upgrade tests fixtures to v8.0.1, with Berlin tests. Skipped several slow tests in Istanbul. Added pytest-timeout to limit annoyance of new slow tests. (`#1971 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1971>`__, `#1987 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1987>`__, `#1991 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1991>`__, `#1989 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1989>`__)
- Make sure Berlin is tested across all core tests. (also patched in some missing Muir Glacier ones) (`#1977 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1977>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.20 (2020-10-21)
----------------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Upgrade rlp library to ``v2.0.0`` stable, which is friendlier to 32-bit and other
  architectures. Downstream applications can choose to explicitly install the rust
  implementation with ``pip install rlp[rust-backend]``.
  (`d553bd <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/commit/d553bd405bbf41a1da0c227a614baba7b43e9449>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.19 (2020-08-31)
----------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add a new hook :meth:`eth.abc.VirtualMachineAPI.transaction_applied_hook` which is triggered after
  each transaction in ``apply_all_transactions``, which is called by ``import_block``. The first use
  case is reporting progress in the middle of Beam Sync. (`#1950 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1950>`__)


Performance improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Upgrade rlp library to ``v2.0.0-a1`` which uses faster rust based encoding/decoding. (`#1951 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1951>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed unused and broken ``add_uncle`` API on ``FrontierBlock`` and
  consequentially on all other derived block classes. (`#1949 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1949>`__)


Internal Changes - for Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improve type safety by ensuring abc types do not inherit from ``rlp.Serializable``
  which implicitly has type ``Any``. (`#1948 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1948>`__)


Miscellaneous internal changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `#1953 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1953>`__


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.18 (2020-06-25)
----------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Expose ``get_chain_gaps()`` on ``ChainDB`` to track gaps in the chain of blocks. (`#1947 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1947>`__)


Internal Changes - for Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Allow `mine_block` of chain builder tools to take a ``transactions`` parameter.
  This makes it easier to model test scenarios that depend on creating blocks
  with transactions. (`#1947 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1947>`__)
- upgrade to Upgrade py-trie to the new v2.0.0-alpha.2 with fixed ``TraversedPartialPath``

py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.17 (2020-06-02)
----------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added support for Python 3.8. (`#1940 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1940>`__)
- Methods now raise :class:`~eth.exceptions.BlockNotFound` when retrieving a block, and some part
  of the block is missing. These methods used to raise a KeyError if transactions were missing, or a
  ``HeaderNotFound`` if uncles were missing:

    - :meth:`eth.db.chain.ChainDB.get_block_by_header`
    - :meth:`eth.db.chain.ChainDB.get_block_by_hash` (it still raises a HeaderNotFound if there is no
      header matching the given hash)
    - :meth:`Block.from_header() <eth.abc.BlockAPI.from_header>` (`#1943 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1943>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- A number of fixes related to checkpoints and persisting old headers, especially
  when we try to persist headers that don't match the checkpoints.

    - A new exception :class:`~eth.exceptions.CheckpointsMustBeCanonical` raised when persisting a
      header that is not linked to a previously-saved checkpoint.
      (note: we now explicitly save checkpoints)
    - More broadly, any block persist that would cause the checkpoint to be decanonicalized will
      raise the :class:`~eth.exceptions.CheckpointsMustBeCanonical`.
    - Re-insert gaps in the chain when a checkpoint and (parent or child) header do not link
    - De-canonicalize all children of orphans. (Previously, only decanonicalized headers with block
      numbers that matched the new canonical headers)
    - Added some new hypothesis tests to get more confidence that we covered most cases
    - When filling a gap, if there's an existing child that is not a checkpoint and doesn't link to
      the parent, then the parent block wins, and the child block is de-canonicalized (and gap added). (`#1929 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1929>`__)


Internal Changes - for Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Upgrade py-trie to the new v2.0.0-alpha.1, and pin it for stability. (`#1935 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1935>`__)
- Improve the error when transaction nonce is invalid: include expected and actual. (`#1936 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1936>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.16 (2020-05-27)
----------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Expose ``get_header_chain_gaps()`` API on HeaderDB to track chain gaps (`#1924 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1924>`__)
- Add a new ``persist_unexecuted_block`` API to ``ChainDB``. This API should be used to persist
  a block without executing the EVM on it. The API is used by
  syncing strategies that do not execute all blocks but fill old blocks
  back in (e.g. ``beam`` or ``fast`` sync) (`#1925 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1925>`__)
- Update the allowable version of `py_ecc` library. (`#1934 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1934>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.15 (2020-04-14)
----------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- :meth:`eth.chains.base.Chain.import_block()` now returns some meta-information about the witness.
  You can get a list of trie node hashes needed to build the witness, as well
  as the accesses of accounts, storage slots, and bytecodes. (`#1917
  <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1917>`__)


Internal Changes - for Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use a more recent eth-keys, which calls an eth-typing that's not deprecated. (`#1665 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1665>`__)
- Upgrade pytest-xdist from 1.18.1 to 1.31.0, to fix a CI crash. (`#1917 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1917>`__)
- Added :class:`~eth.db.accesslog.KeyAccessLoggerDB` and its atomic twin; faster ``make
  validate-docs`` (but you have to remember to ``pip install -e .[doc]`` yourself); ``str(block)`` now
  includes some bytes of the block hash. (`#1918 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1918>`__)
- Fix for creating a duplicate "ghost" Computation that was never used. It didn't
  break anything, but was inelegant and surprising to get extra objects created
  that were mostly useless. This was achieved by changing
  :meth:`eth.abc.ComputationAPI.apply_message` and
  :meth:`eth.abc.ComputationAPI.apply_create_message` to be class methods. (`#1921 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1921>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.14 (2020-02-10)
----------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Change return type for ``import_block`` from ``Tuple[BlockAPI, Tuple[BlockAPI, ...], Tuple[BlockAPI, ...]]`` to ``BlockImportResult`` (NamedTuple). (`#1910 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1910>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a consensus-critical bug for contracts that are created and destroyed in the same block,
  especially pre-Byzantium. (`#1912 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1912>`__)


Internal Changes - for Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add explicit tests for ``validate_header`` (`#1911 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1911>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.13 (2020-01-13)
----------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Make handling of different consensus mechanisms more flexible and sound.

  1. ``validate_seal`` and ``validate_header`` are now instance methods. The only reason they can
  be classmethods today is because our Pow implementation relies on a globally shared cache
  which should be refactored to use the ``ConsensusContextAPI``.

  2. There a two new methods: ``chain.validate_chain_extension(header, parents)`` and
  ``vm.validate_seal_extension``. They perform extension seal checks to support consensus schemes
  where headers can not be checked if parents are missing.

  3. The consensus mechanism is now abstracted via ``ConsensusAPI`` and ``ConsensusContextAPI``.
  VMs instantiate a consensus api based on the set ``consensus_class`` and pass it a context which
  they receive from the chain upon instantiation. The chain instantiates the consensus context api
  based on the ``consensus_context_class``. (`#1899 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1899>`__)
- Support Istanbul fork in ``GOERLI_VM_CONFIGURATION`` (`#1904 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1904>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Do not mention PoW in the logging message that we log when `validate_seal` fails.
  The VM could also be running under a non-PoW consensus mechanism. (`#1907 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1907>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Drop optional ``check_seal`` param from ``VM.validate_header`` and turn it into a ``classmethod``.
  Seal checks now need to be made explicitly via ``VM.check_seal`` which is also aligned
  with ``VM.check_seal_extension``. (`#1909 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1909>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.12 (2019-12-19)
----------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Implement the Muir Glacier fork

  See: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2387 (`#1901 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1901>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.11 (2019-12-12)
----------------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- When double-deleting a storage slot, got ``KeyError: (b'\x03', 'key could not be deleted in
  JournalDB, because it was missing')``. This was fallout from `#1893
  <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/1893>`_ (`#1898 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1898>`__)


Performance improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improve performance when importing a header which is a child of the current canonical
  chain tip. (`#1891 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1891>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.10 (2019-12-09)
----------------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Bug: if data was missing during a call to :meth:`~eth.vm.base.VM.apply_all_transactions`,
  then the call would revert and continue processing transactions. Fix: we re-raise
  the :class:`~eth.exceptions.EVMMissingData` and do not continue processing transactions. (`#1889 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1889>`__)
- Fix for net gas metering (EIP-2200) in Istanbul. The "original value" used to calculate gas
  costs was incorrectly accessing the value at the start of the block, instead of the start of the
  transaction. (`#1893 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1893>`__)


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add Matomo Tracking to Docs site.

  Matomo is an Open Source web analytics platform that allows us
  to get better insights and optimize for our audience without
  the negative consequences of other compareable platforms.

  Read more: https://matomo.org/why-matomo/ (`#1892 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1892>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.9 (2019-12-02)
---------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add new Chain APIs (`#1887 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1887>`__):

  - :meth:`~eth.chains.base.Chain.get_canonical_block_header_by_number` (parallel to :meth:`~eth.chains.base.Chain.get_canonical_block_by_number`)
  - :meth:`~eth.chains.base.Chain.get_canonical_transaction_index`
  - :meth:`~eth.chains.base.Chain.get_canonical_transaction_by_index`
  - :meth:`~eth.chains.base.Chain.get_transaction_receipt_by_index`


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Remove the ice age delay that was accidentally left in Istanbul (`#1877 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1877>`__)


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- In the API docs display class methods, static methods and methods as one group "methods".
  While we ideally wish to separate these, Sphinx keeps them all as one group which we'll
  be following until we find a better option. (`#794 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/794>`__)
- Tweak layout of API docs to improve readability

  Group API docs by member (methods, attributes) (`#1797 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1797>`__)
- API doc additions (`#1880 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1880>`__)

  - Add missing API docs for :class:`~eth.chains.base.MiningChain`.
  - Add missing API docs for :mod:`eth.db.*`
  - Add missing API docs for :class:`~eth.vm.forks.constantinople.ConstantinopleVM`,
    :class:`~eth.vm.forks.petersburg.PetersburgVM` and
    :class:`~eth.vm.forks.istanbul.IstanbulVM` forks
  - Move all docstrings that aren't overly specific to a particular implementation from
    the implementation to the interface. This has the effect that the docstring will
    appear both on the interface as well as on the implementation except for when the
    implementation overwrites the docstring with a more specific descriptions.
- Add docstrings to all public APIs that were still lacking one. (`#1882 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1882>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.8 (2019-11-05)
---------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- *Partly* implement Clique consensus according to EIP 225. The implementation doesn't yet cover
  a mode of operation that would allow to operate as a signer and create blocks. It does however,
  allow syncing a chain (e.g. Görli) by following the ruleset that is defined in EIP-225. (`#1855 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1855>`__)
- Set Istanbul block number for mainnet to 9069000, and for Görli to 1561651, as per
  `EIP-1679 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1679#activation>`_. (`#1858 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1858>`__)
- Make the *max length validation* of the `extra_data` field configurable. The reason for that is that
  different consensus engines such as Clique repurpose this field using different max length limits. (`#1864 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1864>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Resolve version conflict regarding `pluggy` dependency that came up during installation. (`#1860 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1860>`__)
- Fix issue where Py-EVM crashes when `0` is used as a value for `seal_check_random_sample_rate`.
  Previously, this would lead to a DivideByZero error, whereas now it is recognized as not performing
  any seal check. This is also symmetric to the current *opposite* behavior of passing `1` to check
  every single header instead of taking samples. (`#1862 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1862>`__)
- Improve usability of error message by including hex values of affected hashes. (`#1863 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1863>`__)
- Gas estimation bugfix: storage values are now correctly reset to original value if the transaction
  includes a self-destruct, when running estimation iterations. Previously, estimation iterations
  would produce undefined results, if the transaction included a self-destruct. (`#1865 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1865>`__)


Performance improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use new `blake2b-py library <https://github.com/davesque/blake2b-py>`_ for 560x speedup of
  Blake2 F compression function. (`#1836 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1836>`__)


Internal Changes - for Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Update upstream test fixtures to `v7.0.0 beta.1 <https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.1>`_
  and address the two arising disagreements on what accounts should be collected for state trie clearing (as per
  `EIP-161 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-161>`_) if a nested call frame had an error. (`#1858 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1858>`__)

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Add missing ``@abstractmethod`` decorator to ``ConfigurableAPI.configure``. (`#1822 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1822>`__)


Performance improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ~20% speedup on "simple value transfer" benchmarks, ~10% overall benchmark lift. Optimized retrieval
  of transactions and receipts from the trie database. (`#1841 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1841>`__)


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add a "Performance improvements" section to the release notes (`#1841 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1841>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Upgrade to ``eth-utils>=1.7.0`` which removes the ``eth.tools.logging`` module implementations of ``ExtendedDebugLogger`` in favor of the ones exposed by the ``eth-utils`` library.  This also removes the automatic setup of the ``DEBUG2`` logging level which was previously a side effect of importing the ``eth`` module.  See ``eth_utils.setup_DEBUG2_logging`` for more information. (`#1846 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1846>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.5 (2019-08-22)
---------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add EIP-1108 to Istanbul: Reduce EC precompile costs (`#1819 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1819>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Make sure ``persist_checkpoint_header`` sets the given header as canonical head. (`#1830 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1830>`__)


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Remove section on Trinity's goals from the Readme. It's been a leftover from when
  Py-EVM and Trinity where hosted in a single repository. (`#1827 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1827>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.4 (2019-08-19)
---------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add an *optional* ``genesis_parent_hash`` parameter to
  :meth:`~eth.db.header.HeaderDB.persist_header_chain` and
  :meth:`~eth.db.chain.ChainDB.persist_block` that allows to overwrite the hash that is used
  to identify the genesis header. This allows persisting headers / blocks that aren't (yet)
  connected back to the true genesis header.

  This feature opens up new, faster syncing techniques. (`#1823 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1823>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Add missing ``@abstractmethod`` decorator to ``ConfigurableAPI.configure``. (`#1822 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1822>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Remove ``AsyncHeaderDB`` that wasn't used anywhere (`#1823 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1823>`__)


py-evm 0.3.0-alpha.3 (2019-08-13)

Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Setup towncrier to generate release notes from fragment files to  ensure a higher standard
  for release notes. (`#1796 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1796>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Drop StateRootNotFound as an over-specialized version of EVMMissingData.
  Drop VMState.execute_transaction() as redundant to VMState.apply_transaction(). (`#1809 <https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1809>`__)
