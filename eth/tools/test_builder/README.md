# JSON test builder


The JSON test builder found in `eth.tools.test_builder.test_builder` is a library that facilitates
creating standard JSON consensus tests as found in the
[ethereum/tests repository](https://github.com/ethereum/tests). Only VM and state tests are
supported right now.

Tests are generated in two steps. First, a *test filler* is written that contains a high level
description of the test case. Subsequently, the filler is compiled to the actual test in a process
called filling, mainly consisting of calculating the resulting state root.

The test builder represents each stage as a nested dictionary. Helper functions are provided to
assemble the filler file step by step in the correct format. The `fill` function handles
compilation and takes additional parameters that can't be inferred from the filler.

Put new tests in `tests/fillers/vm_fillers` or `tests/fillers/state_fillers`. Use the named tuple
`Test` to combine the filler with fill arguments. Subsequently, import them to
`tests/fillers/build_json.py` and add them to the `DIR_STRUCTURE` dictionary. Finally, run
`build_json.py` to fill the tests and export the resulting JSON files to `tests/fillers/json` and
`tests/fillers/tests`.


## Filler generation

Fillers are generated in a functional fashion by [piping]() a dictionary through a sequence of
functions, e.g.:

```Python
filler = pipe(
    setup_filler("test"),
    pre_state([
        [sender, "balance", 1],
        [receiver, "balance", 0]
    ]),
    expect(
        networks=["Frontier"],
        transaction={
            "to": receiver,
            "value": 1,
            "secretKey": sender_key,
        },
        post_state=[
            [sender, "balance", 0],
            [receiver, "balance", 1],
        ]
    )
)
```

Note that `setup_filler` returns a dictionary, whereas all of the following functions such as
`pre_state`, `expect`, etc. return functions modifying this dictionary.


### `setup_filler(name, environment=None)`

This function kicks off the filler generation process by creating the general filler scaffold with
a test name and general information about the testing environment.

For tests for the main chain, the `environment` parameter is expected to be a dictionary with some
or all of the following keys:

  key                  | description
  ---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `"currentCoinbase"`  | the coinbase address
  `"currentNumber"`    | the block number
  `"previousHash"`     | the hash of the parent block
  `"currentDifficulty"`| the block's difficulty
  `"currentGasLimit"`  | the block's gas limit
  `"currentTimestamp"` | the timestamp of the block

As collations in a shard don't have the same properties as blocks, the environment specification
for sharding tests differs accordingly:

  key                      | description
  -------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------
  `"currentCoinbase"`      | the coinbase address
  `"currentNumber"`        | the collation number
  `"previousHash"`         | the hash of the parent collation
  `"shardID"`              | the ID number of the shard
  `"expectedPeriodNumber"` | the period number in which the collation is supposed to be included
  `"periodStartHash"`      | the hash of the block starting the current period.

For convenience, `setup_main_filler` or `setup_sharding_filler` are provided which are equivalent
to `setup_filler` for the most part, but use appropriate default environments.


### `pre_state(state_definitions)`

This function specifies the state prior to the test execution. Multiple invocations don't override
the state but extend it instead.

In general, the elements of `state_definitions` are nested dictionaries of the following form:

```Python
{
    address: {
        "nonce": <account nonce>,
        "balance": <account balance>,
        "code": <account code>,
        "storage": {
            <storage slot>: <storage value>
        }
    }
}
```

To avoid unnecessary nesting especially if only few fields per account are specified, the following
and similar formats are possible as well:

```Python
(address, "balance", <account balance>)
(address, "storage", <storage slot>, <storage value>)
(address, "storage", {<storage slot>: <storage value>})
(address, {"balance", <account balance>})
```


### `execution(execution)`

For VM tests, this function specifies the code that is being run as well as the current state of
the EVM. State tests don't support this object. The parameter is a dictionary specifying some or
all of the following keys:

  key              | description
  -----------------|------------
  `"address"`      | the address of the account executing the code
  `"caller"`       | the caller address
  `"origin"`       | the origin address (defaulting to the caller address)
  `"value"`        | the value of the call
  `"data"`         | the data passed with the call
  `"gasPrice"`     | the gas price of the call
  `"gas"`          | the amount of gas allocated for the call
  `"code"`         | the bytecode to execute
  `"vyperLLLCode"` | the code in Vyper LLL (compiled to bytecode automatically)


### `expect(post_state=None, networks=None, transaction=None)`

This specifies the expected result of the test.

For state tests, multiple expectations can be given, differing in the the transaction data, gas
limit, and value, in the applicable networks, and as a result also in the post state. VM tests
support only a single expectation with no specified network and no transaction (here, its role is
played by `execution`).

`post_state` is a list of state definition in the same form as expected by `pre_state`. State items
that are not set explicitly default to their pre state.

`networks` defines the forks under which the expectation is applicable. It should be a sublist of
the following identifiers (also available in `ALL_FORKS`):

  - `"Frontier"`
  - `"Homestead"`
  - `"EIP150"`
  - `"EIP158"`
  - `"Byzantium"`
  - `"Sharding"`

As sharding tests require different environment and transaction definitions, one shouldn't mix
`"Sharding"` with other networks.

`transaction` is a dictionary coming in two variants. For the main shard:

  key          | description
  -------------|------------
  `"data"`     | the transaction data,
  `"gasLimit"` | the transaction gas limit,
  `"gasPrice"` | the gas price,
  `"nonce"`    | the transaction nonce,
  `"value"`    | the transaction value

In addition, one should specify either the signature itself (via keys `"v"`, `"r"`, and `"s"`) or
a private key used for signing (via `"secretKey"`).

In contrast, sharding transactions are not signed and have only the following properties:

  key            | description
  ---------------|------------
  `"chainID"`    | the ID number of the chain
  `"shardID"`    | the ID number of the shard
  `"to"`         | the target account address
  `"data"`       | the transaction data
  `"gasLimit"`   | the transaction gas limit
  `"gasPrice"`   | the gas price
  `"accessList"` | the transaction access list
  `"code"`       | the code for contract creation transactions
