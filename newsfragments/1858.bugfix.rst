Update upstream test fixtures to `v7.0.0 beta.1 <https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.1>`_
and address the two arising disagreements on what accounts should be collected for state trie clearing (as per
`EIP-161 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-161>`_) if a nested call frame had an error.
Also, set Istanbul block number for mainnet to 9069000, and for GÃ¶rli to 1561651, as per
`EIP-1679 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1679#activation>`_.
